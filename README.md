Observations & Analysis: 
1) Monthly Geo Data Dashboard depicts the most popular Start and End stations in NY/NJ area. The visualization reveals that the preferred routes differ between members and casual users and that as the weather becomes warmer, users increase their usage of end stations in Manhattan, and the end stations become more diverse and spread out.

Independently of the time of the year, the most popular start stations used by members are Grove Path Station and Hoboken Transit Terminal - both centers of the commuter rail lines. Casual riders use stations closer to the walkway on the South waterfront between Sinatra Drive and Newark Street, which popularity significantly increases in the summer months. 

This data confirms the intuition that those intending to use bikes for daily transportation choose to become members, while tourists and those using bikes for enjoyment opt into the "casual" plan. 

2) Monthly Bike Use Dashboard shows usage differences over six months between two types of users and across different bike types. Unsurprisingly, the ridership increases with the warmer months. However, the proportion of casual-to-member users remains relatively stable, with 30% of all rides recorded each month belonging to non-members.
  
Overall, casual users' average ride length is significantly longer than that of a member, with casual rides on "docked bikes" taking anywhere from two to over three hours on average. Casual users are also the only ones using "docked bikes." Overall, for both electric and classic bikes, the average ride length for a casual rider is approximately double that of a member. The average ride length for electric bikes is the same as that of a classic bike, which may be caused by e-bikes being priced by the minute - even for members. Surprisingly, the average ride length does not significantly increase with warmer months despite the visible end-station spread increase in the summer.         

The number of rides in the evening, 6–10 pm, increases as the months get warmer and days longer. With June and July evening surpassing the afternoon, 2–6 pm, ridership. The casual riders overall have a higher proportion of night rides - especially in the warmer months - than the members. Members, in turn, show a much higher proportion of morning rides, pointing to bikes being a means of commuting.
